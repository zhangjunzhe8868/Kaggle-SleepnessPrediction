The goal of this project is to classify the drowsy driver by using the different features such as head position, eye position, and the eye open percentage.
This is a binary classification problem. I would like to build a baseline model and a machine learning model to solve this problem.
To do the classification, the level of driver drowsiness should be defined. Based on the Drowsy Testing Participant Info, I defined 3 or less are not drowsy but 4 or more are drowsy. However, the threshold of drowsiness can be tuned by clustering method or cross-validation result (try different threshold into the same classification model and check the metrics).
This problem needs some feature engineering and data cleaning before building the classification model. The feature engineering needs to capture the dynamic features based on the timestamp and frame.
